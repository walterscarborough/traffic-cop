# Traffic Cop ðŸš“ðŸš¦

## Overview

This application provides a RESTful interface to the [gatling](https://gatling.io/open-source) load testing library to help easily run load tests in cloud environments.

It was inspired by the work done on the `gatling-runner` tool that Alex Shumilov and I worked on together: https://github.com/poprygun/gatling-runner. 
This new redesign/rewrite is fully tested and allows you to easily change load test configuration without the need to recompile anything.

## Design

This application follows [App Continuum](https://www.appcontinuum.io/) design methodology, and has been designed as a component based monolithic single application.

## Usage

Load tests can be easily configured and run by a HTTP request.
 
Load test traffic can be set to run at a constant number of users per second, a ramped number of users per second (i.e. an increasing number of users per second over time), or as a combination of both.

## Project Dependencies

* JDK 8 or above
* `shellcheck` for running bash linter (`brew install shellcheck`)

### Example Command: Run Load Test

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/run-load-test' -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
    -d '{"baseUrl":"http://localhost:52616","endpoint":"/chachkies","httpMethod":"PUT","payload":"{\"name\": \"my fancy chachkie\"}","constantUsersPerSecond":1,"constantUsersPerSecondDuration":5,"rampUsersPerSecondMinimum":1,"rampUsersPerSecondMaximum":5,"rampUsersPerSecondDuration":5}'
```

In this example, a load test with 1 "user" (aka request) per second will run for 5 seconds. The target server is located at `http://localhost:52616`, using the endpoint `/chachkies`. All requests for this load test will be issued as `PUT` requests with a request body of `{"name": "my fancy chachkie"}`.
It is important to note that the request body json has to be escaped since it is included as the `payload` value in our load test request json.

### Example Command: Read Reports

In your browser, go to: 

```
http://localhost:8080/reports
```

All reports will be listed in chronological order. 
Click on the report that you're interested in to browse it.

Documentation on gatling report details is available from the gatling project: https://gatling.io/docs/current/general/reports/. 

### Run Tests

```
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

### Build

```
./scripts/build-artifact.sh
```

## Future Ideas

* Allowing custom headers to be injected into load test requests.
* Bundling autogenerated Spring Rest Docs into the jar.
* Allowing gatling reports to be downloaded as zip files.
* Any other suggestions?
